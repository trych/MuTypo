# Feature ideas for the MuTypo script

- allow to leave "gaps" within the MuTypo layout via frames that you draw on the page
- snap to baseline grid feature / respect the baseline grid
- introduce a "preMuScript" that allows to replace dots and commas with notes to allow for semi-automated muGlyph splitting
- introduce writing tool to write in MuTypography in InDesign
- paragraph style error (paragraph style selection does not work as intended; this needs more infos)
- first MuGylph bug (first MuGlyph ends up being to large)
