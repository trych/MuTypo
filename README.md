# MuTypo Workshop
On this site you will find some helpful code snippets and links for the Scripting session of the MuTypography seminar.
In the session we will write our first little scripts with the help of [basil.js](http://basiljs.ch/), a scripting library that allows for an easy entry into the world of InDesign scripting.

As the current official version of basil.js is somewhat outdated, please do *not* follow the installation instructions on the official website, but follow these steps instead:

## Install basil.js

- Create a folder named `basiljs` in your system's `Documents` folder
- Right-click and use 'Save target as â€¦' on [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basiljs/basil.js/develop/basil.js) to download a file named `basil.js`
- Move this downloaded file into the new `basiljs` folder
- Download the basil.js example scripts [from here](https://github.com/typografie-haw-hamburg/Typografie-programmieren/raw/master/Material/examples.zip), un-zip the file and move the resulting folder into the `basiljs` folder as well

## Install Sublime Text 3

We also need a code editor to work in. Generally, there are many code editors to choose from, but to work with basil.js the best choice currently is to use Sublime Text 3. Please follow these steps, to download and setup Sublime:

- Download [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and move it to your applications folder
- Download and un-zip [these setting files](https://github.com/typografie-haw-hamburg/Typografie-programmieren/raw/master/Material/ST3_settings.zip), this will result in a folder named `Sublime Text 3`
- Open Sublime, and then go to `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Browse Packages`.
- This opens a folder inside another folder, also named `Sublime Text 3`
- Replace this `Sublime Text 3` folder with the folder of the same name that you un-zipped before
- Restart sublime. If everything worked, you should see a white text window now, instead of the black text window from before.
